# TPA

Adds an easy way for players to teleport to each other.

## COMMANDS
- /tpa <Send a teleport request>
- /tpaccept <Accept a teleport request>
- ~~/tpahere <Send a teleport here request>~~
- ~~/tpahereaccept <Accept a teleport here request (alternative to /tpaccept)>~~
- ~~/back <Go back to your death location [Has to be enabled by an OP]>~~
- ~~/toggleback <Enable /back for all players [OP ONLY]>~~
- ~~/tpatimer <Edit the delay to teleport players>~~
- ~~/setcooldowntimer <Edit the cooldown timer for the tpa command [OP ONLY]>~~
- ~~/tpatoggle <Automatically accept tpa requests>~~

## CONFIGURATION
TPA, when installed, will generate a file named `tpa-config.toml` located at `server-folder\world\serverconfig`. The configuration file updates automatically if changed so a server restart IS NOT required. You can use this file to configure each aspect of the mod as listed:
- Cooldown and Teleportation time
- Message Prefix
- All messages sent automatically by the mod, included error messages.

## WARNING
Since version 1.5.0, the mod is **SERVER-SIDE ONLY**, while versions older to 1.5.0 will be required on the client too.
